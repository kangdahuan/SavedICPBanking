# Create and deploy a financial microservice to Linux on Z using IBM Cloud Private 

In this Code Pattern, you will build and deploy a banking microservice with IBM Cloud private running in the LinuxONE Community Cloud. 

IBM Cloud Private is a private cloud platform for developing and running workloads locally. It is an integrated environment that enables you to design, develop, deploy and manage on-premises, containerized cloud applications behind a firewall. It includes the container orchestrator Kubernetes, a private image repository, a management console and monitoring frameworks.

When you will complete this Code Pattern, you will understand how to:

* Build a Docker image from an existing application.
* Deploy a Docker image to IBM Cloud Private.
* Run the existing application using the IBM Cloud Private catalog.


# Architecture

This journey accesses a fictitious retail banking system called MPLbank. MPLbank integrates an Account Management System running on IBM Mainframe. On top of this component, an API layer based on IBM API Connect has been set up to deliver banking APIs. It makes banking services reachable through APIs from all kind of applications. IBM Cloud private has been configured into the LinuxOne LinuxONE Community Cloud.

1. The user deploys the application based microservice on the Worker Node on Linux on Z using IBM Cloud Private.
2. The user installs and runs an instance of his microservice from IBM Cloud Private. The application calls a banking API published in API Connect.
3. API Connect calls the back-end Z Mainframe through a banking API published in z/OS Connect EE.
4. z/OS Connect EE calls the Account Management System (AMS) running in CICS. A COBOL program processes the request and returns banking data. Finally, banking data are sent back to microservice application in the Worker Node on Linux on Z.

# Step 1 - Discover and locally run the banking application

The objective is to discover the banking application located in the *banking-application* folder. This application is a Node.js application. It will be locally tested before packaging it into a Docker image for IBM Cloud private.

## Part 1 - Discover the banking application

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).

	![alt text](images/github_signup.png "Sign up")
	* Pick a username. This will be referenced later as "YOUR_USERNAME".
	* Enter an email.
	* Create a password.
	* Click **Sign up for GitHub**.
	* Select the plan *Unlimited public repositories for free*.
	* A Confirmation email will be sent. Verify your email address to collaborate in Github.

2. Fork the banking application from this GitHub repository to your own GitHub repository.

	![alt text](images/fork.png "Fork the banking app")
	* Click **Fork**.
	* Github automatically forks this project from this repository *IBM/ICp-banking-microservices* to your repository *YOUR_USERNAME/ICp-banking-microservices*.
	* Discover your forked project (your fresh banking application) in your Github repository *YOUR_USERNAME/ICp-banking-microservices*.

3. Install the [Git command line interface](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line) to manage your GitHub repository. Git has three main commands:
	* *git clone* is the command for creating a local copy of the source code from a GitHub repository.
	* *git pull* is the command for pulling fresh code from a GitHub repository.
	* *git push* is the command for pushing new code to a GitHub repository.

4. Launch a terminal and clone your GitHub repository *ICp-banking-microservices* to create a local copy of your banking application:

   `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ICp-banking-microservices`
    
	![alt text](images/clone.png "Clone the banking app")
	
5. Import the source code into your favorite IDE and take a look at the *banking-application* folder:

	![alt text](images/banking_app_structure.png "Banking application")
	* *app.js*: the application server code.
	* *public/index.html*: the application client code (banking dashboard).
	* *public/css*: the application stylesheet.
	* *public/js*: the JavaScript libraries. *bankingAPI.js* will be modified later to connect the banking application to a real corebanking system through API calls (part 2).
	* *package.json*: the package dependencies file.
	* *Dockerfile*: file to build the docker image. it will be used later (step 2).

## Part 2 - Subscribe to the banking API through the API Developer Portal

1. Sign up for an [IBM ID] if you don't have one already.

2. Go to the [API Developer Portal].

3. Create an account if you have not done that already.

	![alt text](images/createAccount.png "Create Account")
   * Click **Create an Account**.
   * Provide all required information. Be sure to use your IBM ID (email address) for this account.
   * Click **Submit**.

  
   An account activation email will be sent to your registered IBM ID email. Click on the link in this email to activate your account.

4. Login to your account.

5. Create a new application.
	![alt text](images/createApplication.png "Create Application")
	* Click **Apps** from the menu.
	* Click **Create new App**.
	* Fill in all the required fields.
	* Click **Submit**.
	
	Make a note of the *client ID* and *client Secret*. You will need them to access the API later.
	![alt text](images/keyApplication.png "API Keys")


6. Before working with the banking API, you need to subscribe to it first. Display the list of available API products.
	![alt text](images/bankingProduct.png "Choose the default plan")
	* Click **API Products** from the top menu.
	* Click **Banking Product** in the list.

7. Subscribe to the Banking API.
	![alt text](images/APISubscription.png "Subscribe")
	* Click **Subscribe** to the Default Plan.
	
	![alt text](images/APISubscription2.png "Banking Product")
	* Select the App that you have just created before.
	* Click **Subscribe**.
	
8. Modify the *banking-application/js/bankingAPI.js* in your banking application.
	![alt text](images/client_id_secret.png "javascript code")
	* Replace *YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE* by your client ID value from the IBM API developer portal.
	* Replace *YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE* by your client Secret value from the IBM API developer portal.

## Part 3 - Run the banking application with Node.js

1. Install these required components for your environment (Windows, Mac OS, Linux):
	*	[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): Node.js is a javascript application server and will run the banking application.
	* 	[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm): npm resolves Node.js package dependencies. According to your operating system, npm may be distributed with Node.js.

3. Launch a terminal and test if Node.Js and npm are installed in your operating system and added to the system path:
	
	![alt text](images/node-npm-test1.png "npm node test command")
	* Run the command *node -v*. The version is displayed.
	* Run the command *npm -v*. The version is displayed.


3. In the same terminal. Go to your banking application folder:

    `cd ICp-banking-microservices/banking-application`

4. Install Node.Js package dependencies of the banking application using : `npm install package.json`
	![alt text](images/npm-install.png "npm install")
	* As a result, dependencies are installed in your project folder.

5. Run the banking application using : `node banking-application/app.js` :
	![alt text](images/node-app-js.png "node app.js")
	* As a result, The banking application is started.
	


4. Launch a web browser and go to **localhost:3000**. The banking application appears.
    
	![alt text](images/banking_app.png "Banking application")

5. Test your application.

	![alt text](images/banking_app_test.png "Banking application")
    * Select a customer ID.
    * Please wait while the application calls banking data from the Mainframe through API Connect and z/OS Connect EE.
    * The result is displayed in a JSON structure.
    
6. The banking application locally works. Stop the Node.js server with a **SIGINT (CTRL+C)** from the terminal.


## Part 4 - Push the banking application to your GitHub repository

1. Commit the fresh code you modified to add changes to the local repository:

   `git commit -m "Update of bankingAPI.js"`

2. Push the code you commited to transfer the last commit to your GitHub repository *ICp-banking-microservices*:

   `git push`

3. Go back to your online Github repository *ICp-banking-microservices* using the web browser. 

	![alt text](images/commit-push-repo.png "git push")
	* Check that your code has been updated with commit label *Update of BankingAPI.js*

---

:thumbsup: Congratulations! Your banking application locally works and modifications have been pushed to your GitHub repository! Ready for IBM Cloud private?

# Step 2 - Build and deploy a docker image to IBM Cloud private

The objective is to build a Docker image from the banking application and then deploy it to the IBM Cloud private.

## Part 1 - Build the Docker image

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build, users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions, step by step.

1. Take a look at the *banking-application/Dockerfile*:

	![alt text](images/dockerfile.png "Dockerfile")
	* *FROM ibmcom/ibmnode*: This command gathers, from IBM's public Docker repository, a Ubuntu Linux image containing all the basic components to run a Node.js application. It will be used as a basis for our usecase. 
	* *WORKDIR "/app"*: This command creates a directory inside our image, from which we will inject our specific files.
	* *COPY package.json /app/*: This command copies our **package.json** file into the working directory inside our image. This file holds information about the app, most importantly the package dependencies it will need.
	* *RUN cd /app; npm install; npm prune --production*: These commands first move our focus to the working directory, then download and install our app's required dependencies.
	* *COPY . /app*: This command copies everything left of the app into our working directory inside the docker image, i.e. our app's source code.
	* *ENV NODE_ENV production* and *ENV PORT 3000*: These two commands set environment variables. The first one tells our Node.js instance that we run in production mode, and thus don't need development libraries. The other one sets the port 3000 as our main networking port.
	* *EXPOSE 3000*: This command tells docker to map the image's port 3000 to the operating system's port 3000. It will gives us a network access to the docker image and thus the Node.js app.
	* *CMD ["npm", "start"]*: This last command tells Docker what to do when we launch the image, in our case **npm start**, which will start the Node.js app.

## Part 2 - Deploy the docker image to IBM Cloud private

In this Code Pattern, an automatic process (Jenkins build) has been initially set up to build and deploy the Docker image to ICp. 

![alt text](images/devops.png "DevOps")

The Jenkins build processed as follow :

1. Jenkins pulled the source code from a GitHub repository *YOUR_USERNAME/ICp-banking-microservices* like yours.
2. Jenkins built the Docker image from the Docker file described before.
3. Jenkins connected to ICp and then deployed the Docker image to its Docker image repository.

4. Copy and Paste this URL into your browser address bar : `http://148.100.93.200:20002/deploy/YOUR_USERNAME`.	

5. Click **Enter**. The deployment is processing : 
 	* The process pulls your source code from your GitHub repository *YOUR_USERNAME/ICp-banking-microservices*.
 	* The process builds the Docker image from the Docker file described before. It has been called **YOUR_USERNAME-icp-banking-microservices** and tagged *lastest*. It will be refered as **YOUR_IMAGE_NAME**. 
 	* The process connects to ICp and then deploys the Docker image to its Docker image repository.
	
6. Wait for the successful completion message of your build: **Deployment successful**
	
As a result, the banking application is now ready to be instantiated from the ICp catalog.

# Step 3 - Instantiate the banking microservice from the IBM Cloud private catalog

The objective is to discover the IBM Cloud private catalog in order to instantiate a container from your Docker image containing your banking application. In this way, you will be able to test your banking application from ICp.

## Part 1 - Discover the Helm chart from the calalog

1. Obtain an ICP account from your instructor.  It will be similar to *linuxone2018+nn*. 

2. Login to the [IBM Cloud private catalog](https://148.100.92.200:8443/console/welcome) and fill credentials with yours:
	
3. Click the top-right icon  from the menu to access the catalog.
